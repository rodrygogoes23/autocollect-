So this script has been made by _________ (fuck you i ain't selling myself out)

So about this script it is script that took me some time to make but how this works is you must have seen those bots with collection function right? Be the first one to type /collect 'name', and if you are not fast then you are fucked so I made a script just for you
it automatical;ly collects player for you all you need is a Device (PC/Laptop Preferred, for mobile you would need 2 devices)

First of all Star this and fork so you can edit as per your need.

so let's start first of all you can also deploy it on VPS (if you have one to run 24/7)
so For PC/Laptop users first
Download Notepad++ from chrome (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
Then get you API ID and API Hash from (https://my.telegram.org/auth)
Then you need to add a folder where you have to download all the players images with their name like for Eden Hazard save the pic in a collection folder as Eden Hazard 
then just get the group id where you need to collect players from via /id from rose 
and then as for folder paste the dir as "C:\\Users\\Dell\\Downloads\\Telegram Desktop" use double \\

After all this place everything in the script for phone number use + ahead like +9173546xxxxx and for group id use - like -10001xxxxx

now just open command panel and navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the script with command "cd C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Telegram Desktop"
and then install these dependencies "pip install telethon pillow imagehash numpy" if you run into any issue ask ChatGPT
and then after you have everything type 

python autocollect.py

and you are all sorted if any error just ask ChatGPT or i will give a way to ask me 

For android users 
Host this on replit,koyeb,heroku,tmux,termux and use (make sure to keep the chrome window open 24/7 everything is same as windows (replacing files and all)
I will show Replit demo
Download ACode or any other code editor from Playstore
Then get you API ID and API Hash from (https://my.telegram.org/auth)
Then you need to add a folder where you have to download all the players images with their name like for Eden Hazard save the pic in a collection folder as Eden Hazard 
then just get the group id where you need to collect players from via /id from rose 
and then as for folder paste the dir 

Now Deploy on replit
